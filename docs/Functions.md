# Functions

Cool enough, custom functions are possible in this language. You can even return things. Nice, right?

## Defining a function (X)

You can define a function using

````
func myFunction arg1,arg2 {
    //Code here
}
````

Simple enough, right? After a function has been defined, you can reuse these anywhere, like this.

````
myFunction 1,2; //Variables, strings, and integers supported as arguments
````

## Returning a value (X)

You can return value using this.

````
func addOne number {
    return number +;
}
````

Returned functions can be set to as variables or the Single String.

````
a=addOne 1; //a equals 2 now.

str someStringFunction str; //This does whatever this string function does
````

Functions can do a lot, and since I'm nice I'll provide some functions you can put into your own code!
