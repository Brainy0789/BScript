//Some functions to use in BScript.

//Do note functions are supported in the current version of BScript.

//Function that takes two parameters and returns their sum
func add x, y {
    var w;

    (w, y) {
        x +;
        w +;
    }

    return x;
}

//Function that takes two parameters and returns their difference
func subtract x, y {
    var w;

    (w, y) {
        x -;
        w +;
    }

    return x;
}

//Function that takes two parameters and returns their product
func multiply x,y {
    var w;

    (w, y) {
        x = add x, x;
        w +;
    }
    return x;
}

//I actually could not figure out how to make a division function. If anybody figures it out, please tell me!
