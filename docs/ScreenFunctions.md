# Screen Functions

## Creating Windows (X)

````
window;
````

Running this creates a window. Simple as that. Before you run this command, you'll may want to use a couple other commands

## Window Parameters (X)

````
windowSize 1280,720;
windowTitle "Window Name";
window; //Only open the window AFTER the parameters are set. If not, the commands won't do anything.
````

The window paremeters should be pretty self explanatory, but `windowSize` sets the dimensions of the window and `WindowTitle` sets the window title.
