# BScript

BScript is a coding language that is terrible.

[Read the documentation here.](docs/Basics.md)

All you get is simple variables that can only be added or subtracted to (only one), basic loops, really nothings else. It's probably easier than Brainfuck, though. 

Wow, that description is a little outdated.

## Installation

First of all, install [the latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


Secondly, download the source code from here.

Now, finally, run the `setup.py` file inside of Python. It will ask for things and then you can use the `bsc` command to compile BScript files! Neat!
