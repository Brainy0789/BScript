# BScript

BScript is a simple, lightweight 8-bit coding language.

[Read the documentation here.](https://brainy0789.github.io/BScript/basics.html)

## Installation

First of all, install [the latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


Secondly, download the source code from here.

Now, finally, run the `setup.py` file inside of Python. It will ask for things and then you can use the `bsc` command to compile BScript files! Neat!

Or, just download the GUI app if you prefer. It's completely self-contained and required no dependencies.
